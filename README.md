In this report we explore the computational powers and accuracy of polynomial interpolation. The three types of interpolation that we consider through this project are: Monomial basis, Lagrange basis, and Newtons basis. On these interpolation polynomials we need to consider two different types of meshes, the first one we will consider are the intuitive even/ uniform meshes on the selected interval [a, b]. We will then discuss the draw backs to these types of methods as depicted in Runges counter example (f2(x)). To move around these types of obstacles we will also consider a different partition of our [a, b] called the Chebyshev meshes. Graphs and other visual aids are provided to further emphasize the error analysis as well as draw backs and advantages.
